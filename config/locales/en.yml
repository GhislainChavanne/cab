    firm: |
      Created through the merger of two entities sharing common values, Siano is a law firm with offices in Paris and Barcelona, working in all areas of criminal law.
      <br><br>
      The four founding partners, Léa Dordilly, Clémence Witt, Simon Clemenceau and Camille Tardé, three of whom are former “Secrétaires de la Conférence”, have been involved for many years in complex cases, particularly criminal, with high media stakes and an international dimension.
      <br><br>
      Siano’s team assists and defends natural or legal persons, of French and foreign nationality, victims or defendants, in matters of criminal risk prevention and in litigation at every stage of the proceedings (police investigation, judicial investigation, trial).
      <br><br>
      The firm is named after Victoria Kent Siano, one of the first female Spanish lawyers, known for her pioneering humanist, feminist, and abolitionist commitments.
      <br><br>
      With its international expertise, Siano regularly works with <a href="https://www.impactlitigation.fr/" target="_blank" class="text-sianogreen-500">Impact Litigation</a>, a law firm created by Jeanne Sulzer, dedicated to the questions of international justice and human rights.
